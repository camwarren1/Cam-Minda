<h2>What kind of computers you can use</h2>
  <h4>Computers are offered in class, but you'll have homework where you need access to a computer outside of class. A computer that runs OSX or Windows would be easier to work with in this course.<h3>

<h2>Getting familiar with your computer:</h2>
  <h3>The Terminal</h3>
    <h4>You will want to try understand how to use the terminal in your computer. Try a few simple commands (open, list - "ls", change directory - "cd")</h4>

<h2>Setting your computer up:</h2>
  <h3>Google Chrome<h3>
    <h4>Download and install <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/">Google chrome</a>. Chrome is the most adaptable and least buggy browser</h4>
  <h3>Class Folder</h3>
    <h4>Create a folder that you will use for class, most cenveniently on the desktop of your personal computer.

<h2>Preparing to code:</h2>
  <h3>Git software</h3>
    <h4>Visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm</a> to download and install Git software. This will allow your computer to update and share git folders/docs.</h4>

  <h3>Atom</h3>
    <h4>Visit <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and download/install Atom (editor for HTML Docs).</h4>

  <h3>Slack, Github</h3>
    <h4>Make accounts at <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. Your Github account will allow you to store, download, and share Github files with yourself on different computers, or with others for Joint projects. Your slack account is a networking platform for developers.</h4>
